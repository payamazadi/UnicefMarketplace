Bugs discovered 5/28/15
-----------------------
While in course of demo'ing prototype to a friend, I discovered an error that occurs when there are no orders collected on the current day. I resolved that issue. This led me to discover another error that occurs when the 5-day moving average of orders is 0. That occurs while calculating the percentage change between the 2-day and 5-day order count averages. I added a stipulation that if the 5-day average orders is 0, use half of the 2 day average. This again fails when the 2-day average is 1, in which case I just use the 2-day average.
